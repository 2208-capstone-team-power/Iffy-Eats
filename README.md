# Iffy-Eats

An app for those who are indecisive on what to eat. Feed your hangry!


Iffy Eats is an app that takes a user's location and randomly generates a restuarant near them if they are unsure of what to eat. The user may choose to set their search radius up to 20 miles. Once the restaurant has been chosen for the user at random, the user has the options to view the distance on a dynamic map, checkout the Yelp page, get a new restaurant using the same location, or manually enter a new address if a different location is desired. We hope you enjoy using Iffy Eats!
